# J2EE-Web-Components

This repository contains programs developed to explore J2EE web components. 

Installation
To run the programs, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Tomcat installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Java website and the latest version of Tomcat from the official Apache Tomcat website.

Usage
To use the programs, you can clone the repository and deploy the web applications to Tomcat. Each program is contained in a separate folder and can be accessed from a web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL.

Before running the programs, you may need to modify the code to match your specific environment or requirements. For example, you may need to update the connection string in the login form to point to your MSSQL database.

Credits
These programs were created by Jaimaica Daisy Eugenio as part of a course on J2EE web components.
